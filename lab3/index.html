<section><h2>Difficulties</h2>
	 <p class="summary">I didn't run into any significant difficulties with this lab. The file structure and new index.htmls were already established when I cloned Wes' file structure in Github. I did have some trouble resizing my images and making sure they were reponsive. </p></section>

 <section><h2>Results</h2>
		<p class="summary">I am happy with the final result of my lab. I keep using similar styling for the labs because I like the way it looks and want to be able to build on it to create a more polished looking site. I worked on the majority of the lab in class, so I didn't get to see a lot of Ari. However, they were still able to collaborate with me. </p></section>
