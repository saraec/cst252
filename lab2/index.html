 <section><h2>About Me</h2>
 <p class="summary">I am a third year transfer at CSUMB. I am majoring in Communication Design with a concentration in visual design. My favorite hobbies and pass times include watching movies & T.V., painting, and reading occasionally. My favorite films and shows are <span>Killing Eve</span>, any 90's movie with Sandra Bullock, <span>Forrest Gump</span>, and <span>Bones</span>. I recently finished a book titled <span>Her Body and Other Parties</span> by Carmen Maria Machado which is a collection of body horror short stories. Now, I am reading <span>Girl, Interrupted</span> after I watched the movie and found out it was based on a true story. I live in Hollister, but I spend a lot of my time in the surrounding towns. On my days off I like to come to Monterey or go to Santa Cruz, get coffee, shop, get lunch, and go to the beach. </p></section>
