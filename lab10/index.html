						<section><h2>Difficulties</h2>
						 <p class="summary">I had a difficult time with this lab. I felt pretty lost, so I worked backwards by looking at Wes's code. I looked through it to see what they wrote and tried to understand what each function or element was. An issue that kept occuring when I had to change id's of elements in their Javascript so that it matched with my HTML. Figuring out where the mismatches were became a bit difficult. Overall, I don't feel very confident about this lab. I kind of just tried hacking things together until it worked well enough to stop.</p></section>
