						<section><h2>Difficulties</h2>
						 <p class="summary">The only issue I ran into was with Task X. I tried to create a button that added an attribute. It worked before the site was published, but displayed an unknown function error after it was published. Other than that, I didn’t have any trouble with the lab. We essentially did a version of the lab during class, so that made identifying the steps really easy. The most difficult part of the lab, relatively, was making sure I used appendChild correctly. I looked at the example and made sure the output element and not the new elements that I created. Everything seemed to work when I used console.log and checked it in the console. </p></section>
