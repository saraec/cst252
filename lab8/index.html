						<section><h2>Difficulties</h2>
						 <p class="summary">The only difficulty I had was comprehension. During class I understood what each function was doing and the step by step process.
							 For the lab, I hesitated in knowing where to start. Looking at the example, I understood what was happening, but didn't know how to apply that to my own JavaScript. Once I started mapping out the function like we did in class, it became easier.</p></section>

							<section><h2>Results</h2>
								<p>I was able to create functions and define variables, strings, and arrays so that they perform the task that was intended. </p>
								<div id = "output">
									<p>Array: [7, 70, 17, 777, 7000, 71, 77]</p>
									<p>Add Two to the Array: [9, 72, 19, 779, 7002, 73, 79]</p>
									<p>Divide the Array By Two: [3.5, 35, 8.5, 388.5, 3500, 35.5, 38.5]</p>
