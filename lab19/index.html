						<section><h2>Difficulties</h2>
						 <p class="summary">This lab was fairly challenging for me because I don’t think I have a strong grasp of what API’s are or how to use them. I tried to follow the process we went through on JSFiddle. That was helpful in getting the formatt correct, but couldn’t help me all the way through because of the new API I chose. I tried using an API that made me use a key, but then I got a 409 error and couldn’t figure out how to solve it. I looked for a while to find an API I was able to get working. Finally, I found a Parks and Rec themed one that only needed me to define the url. It was only printed in the console at first. So I used the console.log in the JS to help me redefine what I was printing into the HTML.</p></section>
